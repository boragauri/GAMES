This code is associated with the pre-print maunscript "GAMES: A dynamic model development workflow for systematic characterization of synthetic genetic parts." 
Detailed descriptions of the files and functions in this reposotiry are included in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Notes 2-3) of the manuscript.  

Test.py and Run.py are the executable files. Settings.py can be used to change the settings for different simulation runs.

To generate the data in the manuscript, the "model" variable was set to the appropriate model (A, B, C, or D) and the set of free 
parameters (the variable "real_param_labels_free") was set to the appropriate set, as defined in the manuscript.
